  The optical communication is currently focused on data transmission by means confined, in particular optical fiber. We are currently developing technologies to bring the same benefits of high data transfer optical fiber in unconfined means.
The OWC technology (Optical Wireless Communication) is still under development, but have many advantages over communication via radio and other wired communications.
This paper presents the development of a prototype of optical communication for transmitting data using visible light to the human eye. Using microcontrollers for communication between machines, transmitter and receiver, and computers to communicate humans with machine.
The results show that this technology, which is still in development, has a lot of potential for growth in coming years.
